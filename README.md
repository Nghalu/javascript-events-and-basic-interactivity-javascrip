# JavaScript Interactivity assignment
This project demonstrates **JavaScript event handling, interactive elements, and form validation**.  
It’s divided into 3 main parts:
## Part 1: Event Handling Basics
- Using of `addEventListener()` to listen for user actions.
- Examples: 
  - Click events (buttons, dropdowns).
  - Mouse events (FAQ toggle).
  - Form submission events.
## Part 2: Interactive Elements
Dynamic features built with **DOM manipulation + events**:
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle** → Switch page theme.
- **Counter Game** → Increments when the button is clicked.
- **FAQ Section** → Expand/collapse answers when clicked.
- **Dropdown Menu** → Simple dropdown that opens/closes with click.
## Part 3: Form Validation
A **Signup Form** that validates:
- **Name**: Required field.
- **Email**: Checked with regex pattern.
- **Password**: Must be at least 8 characters.
